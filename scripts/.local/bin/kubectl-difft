# This wrapper script exists because while kubectl can be configured to
# use difft, it fails to correctly position extra args, which prevents
# the override flag from working. The result being difft treating the
# inputs as plain text, instead of YAML.

# See: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/1436

# export KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF=kubectl-difft
exec difft --override='*:YAML' "$@"
